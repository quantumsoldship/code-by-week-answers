Congratulations! It's wonderful to see that all the children have been so nice this year! Please convey our heartfelt gratitude to them for their kindness and good behavior. And while you're at it, could you kindly pass on the message to the elves to cease operations at the coal mines? We want to ensure that every child receives the gifts they deserve, and we appreciate the hard work and dedication of the elves in making this possible.
